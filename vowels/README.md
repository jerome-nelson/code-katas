## Instructions
Write a function that returns the number of vowels
used in a string.  Vowels are the characters 'a', 'e'
'i', 'o', and 'u'.

i.e
``` js
  vowels('Hi There!') === 3
  vowels('Why do you ask?') === 4
  vowels('Why?') === 0
```

## Initial Solution
* Requires a map or list of some kind to hold values for comparison
* String needs to be iterated over in order to count values.
